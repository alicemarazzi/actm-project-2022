DRUM PATTERN GENERATOR

AUTHORS: Brusca Alfredo, Marazzi Alice, Pomarico Riccardo

When we decided to develop the Drum Pattern Generator we all had in mind the goal of this software: provide the user with an effective tool that could help with the writing process of a new musical piece. It can automatically generate new patterns through the aid of elements such as kick, snare, high hat, and cymbal. We also added what we called ghost snare, which is the snare playing the ghost notes. The user can continue creating new patterns, by setting some parameters such as the BPM, the level of complexities and the time signature, until a liking pattern is provided.
